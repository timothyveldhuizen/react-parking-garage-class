# React Parking Garage (class components)

A example app using React class components to search for parking garages in the Netherlands.

## Components

ParkingGarages: contains the whole feature of filtering parking garages
SearchPlace: contains input field to search for a parking garage by place
SearchFilter: contains options to filter for parking garage
ParkingGarageList: contains a list of parking garages
ParkingGarageItem: contains parking garage information

## Challenge

The challenge is to build with React class components above components with a correct component communication.
That means data flows down with props or data flows up with events between components.
And having the state / data in the correct components.
